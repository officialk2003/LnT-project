AIM-
To design an alcohol detection system using microcontroller.

RESULT-
Alcohol detecting breathalyser has been designed using micro-controller.
The micro-controller of choice is Arduino UNO. The device was built with simple electronic tools
such as gas sensors (MQ-3 in this case) and LCDs. This helps in the overall cost of the system and
is very feasible. The designed device is able to accurately detect if the individual is under the
influence of permissible / functional amount of alcohol. This helps authorities catch the offenders
and help save lives.
